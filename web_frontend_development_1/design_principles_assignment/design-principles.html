        <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>
        <p><span class="business">Scott's Cheap Flights</span><br>

        <p>Scott's Cheap Flights does a great job with visual hierarchy. The main value proposition, "Never overpay for
          flights again," is in big, bold font that the reader sees first. After that, the reader's eye is naturally
          drawn to the orange call-to-action buttons that contrast with the rest of the page. The cute illustration of a
          vacationer on an exotic beach is the next thing that gets noticed. It is in lighter colors so that it doesn't
          compete with the aforementioned items. The final detail that the reader notices is the smaller text about
          saving up to 90% on flights. The nice visual hierarchy of the page probably increases the conversion rate for
          Scott's Cheap Flights.</p>

        <h2>PARC: Repetition</h2>
        <p><span class="business">Six Sisters' Stuff</span><br>

        <p>While there are other good design principles in play on this page, the one that stands out to me is
          repetition. Each recipe is displayed in a box of the same size following the same pattern. First, there is a
          delicious-looking picture of the recipe. The recipe title comes next. Underneath the title is a little clock
          icon with the estimated time that the recipe takes. By repeating the same look and feel for each recipe, the
          universe feels in balance and the sight maintains its consistency.</p>

        <h2>White Space and Clean Design</h2>
        <p><span class="business">Healthline</span><br>
        <a href="https://www.healthline.com">healthline.com</a>
        </p>
        <img src="images/healthlinepic.jpg" alt="Healthline mobile view">
        <p>This mobile view of Healthline is very simple and uncluttered. There is a lot of white space between each
          topic and there are just three topics visible at a time. This provides visual "breathing space" and keeps the
          reader from being overwhelmed.</p>
