      <h2>Ch. 2: Programming Basics</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>best practice: terminate statements with a semicolon and a new line</li>
        <li>operator=acts, does something; operand=acted upon, the thing the operator is doing something with</li>
        <li>use const or let to assign variables</li>
        <li>const is used for variables that won't change and should be used more often than let</li>
        <li>let should only be used if a variable really will need to change later in the program</li>
        <li>check the value of a variable by entering the variable name into the console and pushing enter</li>
        <li>javascript maintains compatability with older code--won't suddenly just change what a keyword does because that will throw off all of the older code on the internet</li>
        <li>variables with global scope tend to be problematic and should be kept to a minimum</li>
        <li>camel case is more commonly used than underscores for separating multiple words in a constant/variable name--but either style can be used just be consistent</li>
        <li>properties are info about the data/object; methods do something with the data/object</li>
        <li>in Javascript, even primitive data types are treated as objects with properties/methods</li>
        <li>methods end in ()</li>
        <li>you can use the backslash to escape special characters such as quotation marks or backticks so that they don't mess up your code</li>
        <li>template literals are made using ` and you can throw javascript in them using ${}</li>
        <li>javascript is a weakly typed language which means that you don't have to say what type of data your variable contains</li>
        <li>undefined means a variable hasn't been given a value</li>
        <li>logical operators = !(not), &&(and), ||(or)</li>
      </ul>

     <h2>Ch. 3: Arrays, Logic, and Loops</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>use [] to enclose an array</li>
       <li>.pop(removes last item in array)</li>
       <li>.shift(removes first item in array)</li>
       <li>.push(adds new item to end of array)</li>
       <li>.unshift(adds new item to beginning of array)</li>
       <li>.concat(combines arrays)</li>
       <li>.join(turns array into a string separated by commas or whatever you put in the paranthesis)</li>
       <li>.slice(returns items indexed from the first number in paranthesis to--but not including--the second number in paranthesis). Slice does not remove those items from the list.</li>
       <li>.splice(finds the item indexed at the first number in paranthesis, removes the number of items indicated by the second number in parantheis, and replaces those items with what you tell it in paranthesis) Can also use splice to insert a new item without removing an item if the second number in paranthesis is 0. Can also use splice to completely delete an item if you don't indicate something to replace it with in paranthesis.</li>
       <li>.reverse(flips the order of the array permanently)</li>
       <li>.sort(automatically puts strings in alphabetical order, orders numbers based on the first number in the digit)</li>
       <li>.indexOf(will tell where the first occurence of an item is in the index) If the item isn't in the index, it will return -1</li>
       <li>.includes(will return true or false depending on if the item is in the array or not)</li>
       <li>multidimensional arrays=arrays that store other arrays</li>
       <li>use two or more sets of brackets to refer to the value that you're looking for in a multidimensional array: [where the item is in the first array][item index for the second array]</li>
       <li>sets are similar to arrays but they don't use index notation and they don't allow duplicate items in the list</li>
     </ul>

      <h2>Questions from This Week's Reading</h2>
      <ul>
       <li>I'm completely confused about the primitive data type "symbols." I looked up the other article mentioned in the textbook, but it was still really confusing.</li>
      <li>Bitwise and bases=very confusing</li>
      <li>Spread method? Huh? What do they mean by spreading out the array?</li>
      </ul>
