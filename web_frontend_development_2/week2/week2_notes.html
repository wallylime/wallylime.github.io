      <h2>Ch. 2: Programming Basics</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>best practice: terminate statements with a semicolon and a new line</li>
        <li>operator=acts, does something; operand=acted upon, the thing the operator is doing something with</li>
        <li>use const or let to assign variables</li>
        <li>const is used for variables that won't change and should be used more often than let</li>
        <li>let should only be used if a variable really will need to change later in the program</li>
        <li>check the value of a variable by entering the variable name into the console and pushing enter</li>
        <li>javascript maintains compatability with older code--won't suddenly just change what a keyword does because that will throw off all of the older code on the internet</li>
        <li>variables with global scope tend to be problematic and should be kept to a minimum</li>
        <li>camel case is more commonly used than underscores for separating multiple words in a constant/variable name--but either style can be used just be consistent</li>
        <li>properties are info about the data/object; methods do something with the data/object</li>
        <li>in Javascript, even primitive data types are treated as objects with properties/methods</li>
        <li>methods end in ()</li>
        <li>you can use the backslash to escape special characters such as quotation marks or backticks so that they don't mess up your code</li>
        <li>template literals are made using ` and you can throw javascript in them using ${}</li>
        <li>javascript is a weakly typed language which means that you don't have to say what type of data your variable contains</li>
        <li>undefined means a variable hasn't been given a value</li>
        <li>logical operators = !(not), &&(and), ||(or)</li>
      </ul>

     <h2>Ch. 3: Arrays, Logic, and Loops</h2>
     <p>The majority of people use mobile devices and not desktops to view webpages. Get with the times and always design for mobile before you even worry about designing for larger screens. Here are some takeaways:</p>

      <h2>Questions from This Week's Reading</h2>
      <p>I'm completely confused about the primitive data type "symbols." I looked up the other article mentioned in the textbook, but it was still really confusing.</p>
      <p>Bitwise and bases=very confusing</p>
