      <h2>Ch. 2: Programming Basics</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>best practice: terminate statements with a semicolon and a new line</li>
        <li>operator=acts, does something; operand=acted upon, the thing the operator is doing something with</li>
        <li>use const or let to assign variables</li>
        <li>const is used for variables that won't change and should be used more often than let</li>
        <li>let should only be used if a variable really will need to change later in the program</li>
        <li>check the value of a variable by entering the variable name into the console and pushing enter</li>
        <li>javascript maintains compatability with older code--won't suddenly just change what a keyword does because that will throw off all of the older code on the internet</li>
        <li>variables with global scope tend to be problematic and should be kept to a minimum</li>
        <li>camel case is more commonly used than underscores for separating multiple words in a constant/variable name--but either style can be used just be consistent</li>
        <li>properties are info about the data/object; methods do something with the data/object</li>
        <li>in Javascript, even primitive data types are treated as objects with properties/methods</li>
        <li>methods end in ()</li>
        <li>you can use the backslash to escape special characters such as quotation marks or backticks so that they don't mess up your code</li>
        <li>template literals are made using ` and you can throw javascript in them using ${}</li>
        <li>javascript is a weakly typed language which means that you don't have to say what type of data your variable contains</li>
        <li>undefined means a variable hasn't been given a value</li>
        <li>logical operators = !(not), &&(and), ||(or)</li>
      </ul>

     <h2>Ch. 3: Arrays, Logic, and Loops</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>use [] to enclose an array</li>
       <li>.pop(removes last item in array)</li>
       <li>.shift(removes first item in array)</li>
       <li>.push(adds new item to end of array)</li>
       <li>.unshift(adds new item to beginning of array)</li>
       <li>.concat(combines arrays)</li>
       <li>.join(turns array into a string separated by commas or whatever you put in the paranthesis)</li>
       <li>.slice(returns items indexed from the first number in paranthesis to--but not including--the second number in paranthesis). Slice does not remove those items from the list.</li>
       <li>.splice(finds the item indexed at the first number in paranthesis, removes the number of items indicated by the second number in parantheis, and replaces those items with what you tell it in paranthesis) Can also use splice to insert a new item without removing an item if the second number in paranthesis is 0. Can also use splice to completely delete an item if you don't indicate something to replace it with in paranthesis.</li>
       <li>.reverse(flips the order of the array permanently)</li>
       <li>.sort(automatically puts strings in alphabetical order, orders numbers based on the first number in the digit)</li>
       <li>.indexOf(will tell where the first occurence of an item is in the index) If the item isn't in the index, it will return -1</li>
       <li>.includes(will return true or false depending on if the item is in the array or not)</li>
       <li>multidimensional arrays=arrays that store other arrays</li>
       <li>use two or more sets of brackets to refer to the value that you're looking for in a multidimensional array: [where the item is in the first array][item index for the second array]</li>
       <li>sets are similar to arrays but they don't use index notation and they don't allow duplicate items in the list</li>
       <li>maps can use more than strings as key values</li>
       <li>maps can use .size property to see how many key-value pairs there are</li>
       <li>the ternary operator is a shortcut for if-else statements: condition? code if true: code if false;</li>
       <li>the switch operator can make code more succint and readable if there's a long list of if-else statements</li>
       <li>while loops:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>must initialize the variable before the loop</li>
          <li>format = while(condition) {bla bla}</li>
          <li>while loops only run when the condition is still true; beware of creating an infinte loop where the condition is always true</li>
        </ul>
        <li>do-while loops:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>format = do{bla bla statements} while(condition)</li>
          <li>this type of loop will always run the first time because it hasn't checked the condition yet</li>
        </ul>
        <li>for loops:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>most common type of loop</li>
          <li>format = for(initialization; condition; after) {bla bla statemnents}</li>
          <li>iniitalization = initialize variable; condition = condition that has to be met for the loop to run; after = what to do after running through the statements in the for block (after is usually some kind of counter that increments up or down)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>for-of loops:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>used to loop through each item in an array</li>
          <li>format = for(const variableName of arrayName){bla bla statements}</li>
        </ul>
     </ul>

      <h2>Ch. 4: Functions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>functions reduce repetition</li>
        <li>write a function like this: function functionName() {bla bla block of code}</li>
        <li>Or write an anonymous function like this: const variableName = function() {bla bla block of code};</li>
        <li>can assign a named function to a variable too: const variableName = function functionName() {bla bla block of code};</li>
        <li>when storing a function in a variable, don't forget the semicolon at the end</li>
        <li>DRY principle of coding stands for "Don't Repeat Yourself"</li>
        <li>must have paranthesis to invoke a function</li>
        <li>if you've stored your function in a variable, you can type the variable name followed by paranthesis to invoke the function</li>
        <li>parameters help define what the argument that will be passed into the function should be and the parameters can be used in the function just like a variable</li>
        <li>the argument(s) are passed to the function when it is invoked and are used in the place of the parameters</li>
        <li>example of parameters and arguments: function calculateBodyMassIndex(height, weight) {bla bla} Height and weight are parameters that help define what the arguments should be. When this function is invoked, the actual height and weight of the person are passed in as arguments. For example calculateBodyMassIndex(5'11, 190)</li>
        <li>when an unknown number of arguments can be passed into a function, use the rest operator (...) in the parameter and the arguments will be stored in an array</li>
        <li>Here's an example of using the rest operator to calculate the mean of an unknown number of arguments: function mean(...values) {
          let total = 0;
          for(const value of values) {
              total += value;
          }
          return total/values.length;
      } The array that is created from the entered arguments is stored as "values."</li>
        <li>default parameters can be set like this: function functionName(parameter = "defaultParameter") {bla} If someone does not pass an argument to this function, it will automatically be set to the default parameter</li>
        <li>default parameters should always follow after regular parameters</li>
        <li>arrow functions are a new way of defining a function that goes like this:
          <ul>
            <li>const variableName = parameter => statementsHere; This is the format if there is only one parameter and one statement. There's no need to include the keyword "return;" it will do that automatically.</li>
            <li>const variableName = (parameter1, parameter2, etc.) => statementsHere; This is the format for multiple parameters and just one statement.</li>
            <li>const variableName = (parameter1, parameter2) => {multiple statements} This is the format if there are multiple statements in the block of code. The keyword "return" is needed again.</li>
          </ul></li>
        <li>arrow functions are always anonymmous, so you have to refer to them by the variableName</li>
        <li>arrow functions are best for small functions</li>
        <li>Function hoisting means that when a function is declared anywhere in the Javascript code, it gets "hoisted" to the top and can be accessed even before it appears in the code. This could allow the coder to group all of their functions together at the end of the code.</li>
        <li>Variable hoisitng means that variables that are declared with the "var" keyword get hoisted to the top. HOWEVER, the variable assignment does NOT get hoisted to the top which seems problematic and somewhat useless. Be especially aware of this when defining an anonymous function that is assigned to a variable.</li>
        <li>a function can be passed into another function as an argument (this is called a callback)</li>
        <li>When a function is passed into another function as an argument, it does not need the paranthesis. For it to be invoked, however, it would need to be called with the paranthesis inside of the other function</li>
        <li>.forEach method can be used to loop through an array</li>
        <li>.map method can be used to loop through an array, do something to it, and create a new array</li>
        <li>.reduce method iterates over an array and returns a single value</li>
        <li>.filter checks for truthy values in an array using the argument you pass it</li>
        <li>iterators can be chained together to do cool stuff</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Questions from This Week's Reading</h2>
      <ul>
       <li>I'm completely confused about the primitive data type "symbols." I looked up the other article mentioned in the textbook, but it was still really confusing.</li>
      <li>Bitwise and bases=very confusing</li>
      <li>Spread method? Huh? What do they mean by "spreading out" the array?</li>
      </ul>
