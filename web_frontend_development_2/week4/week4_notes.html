      <ul>
        <li>using document.forms will return a list of all of the forms in the document, so you have to use either index notation or dot notation with the form's name to find what you're looking for
          <div class="example">const formVariable = document.forms[indexNumber] or const formVariable = document.forms.formNameHere or const formVariable = document.forms["formNameHere"]</div></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja-2nd-edition/read/8/k01nwujl?fromShare=true">checkbox inputs</a> need to all have the same name property to be grouped together</li>
        <li>checkbox inputs are considered checked when their boulean value is true and unchecked when false</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja-2nd-edition/read/8/k01nwuk1?fromShare=true">radio buttons</a> are like the checkbox input except that only one option can be selected
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja-2nd-edition/read/8/k01nwumh?fromShare=true">the submit button</a> can be disabled if there are invalid form inputs</li>

     <h2><a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja-2nd-edition/read/12">Ch. 12: Object-Oriented Programming</a></h2>
     <ul>
       <li>class declarations and constructor functions are both capitalized</li>
       <li><a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja-2nd-edition/read/12/k01nwv9q?fromShare=true">class declarations</a> are better than constructor functions</li>
       <li><a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja-2nd-edition/read/12/k01nwva7?fromShare=true">static methods</a> are available only to the class and not instances of the class</li>
       <li>properties and methods can be added to a class using the prototype property
         <div class="example">Class.prototype.newPropertyName = "New Property Value";<br>
        Class.prototype.newMethodName = function () {return statement;}</div>
       </li>
       <li>prototype properties will be shared by all the objects that share the same class; they are not customizable and are not considered the object's "own" property</li>
       <li>here's the difference between <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja-2nd-edition/read/12/k01nwvc8?fromShare=true">private and public properties/methods</a></li>
       <li>one class can inherit from another using <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja-2nd-edition/read/12/k01nwvdc?fromShare=true">extends</a></li>
       <li><a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja-2nd-edition/read/12/k01nwvf6?fromShare=true">getter and setter methods</a> are especially used when a property value is dependent on other property values</li>
       <li>getter and setter methods allow more control over property assignment</li>
       <li>instead of using classes, you can create an exact copy of an object with <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja-2nd-edition/read/12/k01nwvfp?fromShare=true">.create</a>
      <div class="example">const ObjectYouWantToCopy = {property1: 1, property2: 2, etc.};<br>
      const newObjectName = Object.create(ObjectYouWantToCopy);
    </div> </li>
    <li>if you change the prototype object, it will affect all of the other objects that use it as their prototype</li>
    <li>the instanceof operator only works on objects built with constructor functions</li>
    <li>object properties can be given through assignment like this: 
      <div class="example">const a = {};
        const b = { name: 'JavaScript' };
        Object.assign(a,b)
        << { name: 'JavaScript' }
        a.name
        << 'JavaScript'</div></li>
    <li>the problem with assignment is that arrays and functions that are stored as properties only REFERENCE the original; they don't store their own copy of the property value</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja-2nd-edition/read/12/k01nwvh7?fromShare=true">mixins</a> are functions that can be used to assign "deep" object properties (properties that aren't just REFERENCING)</li>
    <li>the variable "this" can get messy and refer to the wrong object</li>
    <li>there are several methods for pinpointing what "this" is referring to, including using <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja-2nd-edition/read/12/k01nwviz?fromShare=true">that = this</a></li>
    <li>try to make objects like small, reusable blocks that can be used to build bigger things</li>
     </ul>

      <h2><a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja-2nd-edition/read/15/k01nwvxr">Modular JavaScript</a></h2>
      <ul>
        <li>you can organize different parts of Javascript into files called modules</li>
        <li>the keywords <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja-2nd-edition/read/15/k01nwvxy?fromShare=true">"export" and "import" </a>are used to actually access the code from another file</li>
