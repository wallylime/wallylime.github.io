      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I graduated in 2009 with a bachelor's degree in psychology. After graduating, I chose to be a stay-at-home mom. In 2021, I went back to school and earned a certificate in web frontend. I love UI/UX design because it is the perfect fusion of my artistic, creative side with my background in psychology. I am excited to re-enter the workforce and am looking for an internship or entry-level position where I can continue to learn and hone my customer-focused approach.</p>

      <h2>Frontend Design Philosophy</h2>
      <p>The most important thing in frontend web design isn't a thing at all; it's a person! It's the end user! I understand the importance of thinking about psychology and marketing before ever writing a line of code. I believe in designing interfaces that meet the needs and wants of the customer while simultaneously looking great.</p>
      <p>One of the best ways to create a user-friendly design that looks great is to remember the principle of visual hierarchy. Whatever the user should see or do first needs to stand out. I also believe it's important to avoid overwhelming the user with too much content on the screen. Keep it clean. Keep it simple. Keep the important things obvious.</p>

      <h3>Hard Skills</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Responsive, mobile-first design</li>
        <li>HTML5</li>
        <li>CSS/SASS</li>
        <li>Javascript</li>
        <li>Adobe Creative Cloud</li>
        <li>JSON</li>
        <li>APIs</li>
        <li>Github</li>
      </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="indent">
      <h3>Soft Skills</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="list-emphasis">I'm user focused.</span> A website's design isn't about what I want or what I think is cool; it's about the target audience. What does the selected demographic need or want?</li>
        <li><span class="list-emphasis">I like to be organized.</span> Well-organized code saves time and reduces headaches. Well-organized websites are easy for users to navigate and for web crawlers to index.</li>
        <li><span class="list-emphasis">I'm a problem solver.</span> When something doesn't work, there's usually a way over it, around it, or under it. I'm not afraid to come up with creative solutions.</li>
        <li><span class="list-emphasis">I'm good at Googling things.</span> When I encounter a problem in coding, my first line of defense is a search engine. It's also important to learn new skills continually and Google is a big part of that.</li>
        <li><span class="list-emphasis">I pay attention to detail.</span> Some people say that they dot their i's and cross their t's; I would say that I remember my semicolons and paranthesis.</li>
        <li><span class="list-emphasis">I love graphic design.</span> One of my favorite classes was Visual Media which was all about design principles, typography, and using the Adobe Creative Cloud. I got 100% in that class and loved every minute.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Work Examples</h2>
      <p>Here are a few examples of my work from class assignments.</p>
      <div class="examples">
        <h3><a href="web_frontend_development_2/final_project/index.html" target="_blank">Menu Planner & Shopping List </a>&#8599;</h3>
        <p>For this assignment, I had to come up with an app that used a third-party API and local storage. I decided to make a menu planner app that would tailor the recipe results to how busy the user planned on being on a particular day. For example, if the user clicks that they are busy, the recipe results that are returned are for recipes that take under 30 minutes to prepare. The user's selections are then saved in local storage.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="examples">
        <h3><a href="web_frontend_development_1/chamber_of_commerce_project/index.html" target="_blank">Chamber of Commerce Site </a>&#8599;</h3>
        <p>The goal of this assignment was to design a fake chamber of commerce website for my city of residence. There were many specific requirements for the assignment, such as using a weather API, designing the shortcut icon, creating a form, embedding a map, and so on.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="examples">
        <h3><a href="visual_media/magazine-ad.pdf" target="_blank">Creative Ad </a>&#8599;</h3>
        <p>This assignment was from my Visual Media class. The brief for this assignment was to come up with a creative ad for a computer-generated household object and a computer-generated demographic. My computer-generated object was a desk organizer and my demographic was married females between the ages of 35-44 who would see the ad in a magazine. I designed the ad in Adobe Photoshop.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="examples">
        <h3><a href="visual_media/icon-set.pdf" target="_blank">Icon Set </a>&#8599;</h3>
        <p>This assignment was also from my Visual Media class. I had to use Adobe Illustrator to design a set of four icons based around a common theme. The theme that I came up with was "mom nag icons." One of my icons is a reminder to flush the toilet, one is a reminder to wash your hands, one is a reminder to hang up wet towels, and one is a reminder to rinse dirty dishes. I used repeating shapes and colors to make the set look cohesive.</p>
